    // Reflecting the change in the production method, we might want to add tests that verify
    // the successful addition of data is correctly represented in the new list-based structure.
    // However, without direct visibility into how the list is accessed or verified within the test context,
    // these additional tests are conceptual and would require implementation details to be fully realized.

    // Example conceptual test (implementation details needed):
    // verifyListAddition(FILE, "input"); // Verify that adding a file results in the correct list state
