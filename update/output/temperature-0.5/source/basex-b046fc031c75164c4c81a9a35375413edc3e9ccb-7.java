    // This is a generic representation and should be replaced with actual operation code.
    // For example: query(_FILE_READ.args(nonExistentFilePath));
    
    // Assuming there is a mechanism to assert that an error is thrown,
    // and there's a specific method to handle such errors in tests.
    // The actual assertion should check for the specific error code or message indicating a file not found situation.
    // Since the direct reference to the error constant is not possible in this hypothetical scenario,
    // the line below is commented out and serves as a placeholder for the correct implementation.
    // error(nonExistentFilePath, Err.FILE_NOT_FOUND); // This line is illustrative and should be adapted.
    
    // Note: The correct approach involves using the specific error handling mechanism provided by the testing framework
    // and the project's error handling conventions. The actual implementation depends on the project's structure
    // and the classes available for error management and assertion.
