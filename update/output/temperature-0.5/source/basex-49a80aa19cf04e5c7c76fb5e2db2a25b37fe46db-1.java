    // Assuming assertUriIsAbsolute method correctly simulates the parsing and validation process
    // Test cases for URIs that have a scheme but are marked as invalid by the parsing logic
    assertUriIsAbsolute("http://", false); // No host, might be considered invalid
    assertUriIsAbsolute("ftp://user@", false); // No host part after user info, could be considered invalid depending on parsing logic

    // Test case for a URI that is typically considered network-path reference which might be considered not absolute in new logic
    // This test case is commented out in the old version, suggesting a behavior change or clarification might be needed
    assertUriIsAbsolute("//localhost:80", false);

    // Test case for a URI with fragment, which should not affect its absoluteness but rather its validity
    // This test case is also commented out in the old version, suggesting a possible change in how fragments are considered in URI validity
    assertUriIsAbsolute("http://localhost:80/html#f", true);

    // Additional test cases to cover more scenarios based on the new logic
    // These are inspired by the changes and the sample diffs provided, aiming to ensure broad coverage
    assertUriIsAbsolute("mailto:user@example.com", true); // Scheme with no slashes, valid URI
    assertUriIsAbsolute("urn:isbn:0451450523", true); // Another example of scheme without slashes
