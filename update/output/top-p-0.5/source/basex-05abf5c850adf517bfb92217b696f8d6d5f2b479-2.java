@Test
public void deletePerformance() {
  // The VERBOSE flag check and related output have been removed from the production method,
  // so they are no longer relevant to the test method.
  deletePerformance(testedmap, basemap);
  
  // Since the performance timing and verbose output have been removed from the production method,
  // this test should focus on verifying the correct functionality of the delete operation itself.
  // This could involve checking the state of testedmap and basemap after the delete operation
  // to ensure they reflect the expected state. However, without specific details on the implementation
  // of these maps or the deletePerformance method, we cannot provide a detailed assertion here.
  // Example assertion (pseudocode):
  // assertTrue("Maps should be in expected state after delete", mapsAreInExpectedState(testedmap, basemap));
