  // Reflecting changes in the production method where the determination of an absolute URI
  // now depends on the validity and presence of a scheme in the parsed URI object.

  assertUriIsAbsolute("x", false); // No scheme delimiter ":"

  // Considering the new implementation, these cases might need re-evaluation
  // if the logic for handling "//" (authority without scheme) or fragments has changed.

  // Assuming "//localhost:80" is not considered absolute without a scheme

  // but need to check if fragment presence affects absoluteness.
