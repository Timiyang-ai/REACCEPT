    // Assume that some underlying logic in archive creation or other areas now leverages the MainOptions
    // in a way similar to the observed production changes, we would test as follows:

    // Setup context with different MainOptions settings could be envisioned here
    // context.set(MainOptions.FORCECREATE, true/false);
    // Proceed to create archive or interact with the database based on those settings.

    // Simulated archive creation based on option, not directly related but follows the principle
    query(COUNT.args(_ARCHIVE_CREATE.args(archEntry, "", options)), "1");

    // The verification below would belong to a situation where you directly
    // manipulate or check MainOptions akin to the production changes
    // Assert.assertEquals(context.options.get(MainOptions.SOME_RELEVANT_OPTION), expectedValue);

    // This is a placeholder to reflect direct interactions and verifications with MainOptions
    // not directly applicable but indicates the general direction for new tests based on option manipulations
