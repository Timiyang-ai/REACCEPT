  // Now, we need to assert the post-conditions mentioned in the production code's modifications:
  // The list should be empty (size reset to 0).
  assertEquals(0, il.size());
  
  // To further ensure the internal state has been reset and is re-usable as per the modifications,
  // we add a new item and check the size again.

  assertEquals(1, il.size());
  
  // Optionally verify the initial capacity reset if that's part of the intended effect (assuming CAP is accessible).
  // This would ensure the `values` array within the list is indeed reset to a new Item array with CAP size.
  // However, without direct access to internal `values`, this might not be directly verifiable unless exposed
  // or indirectly inferred from behavior.
