@Test
public void deletePerformance() {
  // Removed the VERBOSE check and direct performance logging as it is no longer part of the method implementation.
  deletePerformance(testedmap, basemap);
  
  // Since the performance logging has been removed from the method,
  // and based on the example provided, it's clear that direct performance measurement
  // within the test is not the focus and has been streamlined away.
  // Any additional assertions or checks would need to focus on the effects of deletion
  // such as verifying the expected state of testedmap and basemap after the operation.
  // However, without specifics on the state checks post-deletion, this is a basic structure.
  
  // Example assertion to validate post-operation state if applicable:
  // assertTrue("Map should be empty after deletion", testedmap.isEmpty());
  // Note: The above assertion is purely illustrative. Actual validation should match the expected effect
  // of deletePerformance on testedmap and basemap.
